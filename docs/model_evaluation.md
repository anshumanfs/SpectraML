# Model Evaluation

[← Back to Index](index.md)

Proper evaluation of machine learning models is essential to ensure they perform well on unseen data and meet the requirements of your application. This guide covers evaluation metrics, validation techniques, and best practices for assessing model performance.

## Importance of Model Evaluation

Effective model evaluation helps:

- **Assess Generalization**: Determine how well your model will perform on new, unseen data
- **Compare Models**: Select the best model from multiple candidates
- **Tune Hyperparameters**: Optimize model configuration for best performance
- **Detect Overfitting/Underfitting**: Identify when models are too complex or too simple
- **Build Trust**: Provide confidence in model predictions to stakeholders

## Regression Metrics

- **Mean Absolute Error (MAE)**: Average of absolute differences between predicted and actual values
- **Mean Squared Error (MSE)**: Average of squared differences between predicted and actual values
- **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**: Square root of MSE
- **R-squared (R²)**: Proportion of variance explained by the model
- **Adjusted R-squared**: Accounts for the number of predictors in the model
- **Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE)**: Percentage-based error calculation

## Classification Metrics

- **Accuracy**: Proportion of correct predictions
- **Precision**: Proportion of true positives among predicted positives
- **Recall**: Proportion of true positives among actual positives
- **F1 Score**: Harmonic mean of precision and recall
- **ROC Curve & AUC**: Plot of TPR vs FPR at different thresholds
- **Confusion Matrix**: Tabular representation of predictions vs actuals

## Cross-Validation Techniques

- **Train-Test Split**: Simple division of data into training and test sets
- **K-Fold Cross-Validation**: Multiple train-test iterations with different data partitions
- **Leave-One-Out**: Extreme form of cross-validation with single sample test sets
- **Stratified Cross-Validation**: Maintains class proportions in each fold
- **Time Series Cross-Validation**: Respects temporal nature of data

## Common Pitfalls

- **Data Leakage**: Information from outside training data improperly influencing the model
- **Selection Bias**: Non-representative selection of training data
- **Overfitting to the Validation Set**: Making too many decisions based on validation performance
- **Improper Metric Selection**: Using metrics that don't align with business objectives
- **Ignoring Confidence Intervals**: Not accounting for variability in performance estimates
