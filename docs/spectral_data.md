[‚Üê Back to Index](index.md)

Spectral data analysis requires specialized techniques due to its unique characteristics. This guide covers methods specific to working with spectroscopic data in machine learning workflows.

## Understanding Spectral Data

### Types of Spectroscopy

- **Infrared (IR) Spectroscopy**: Measures absorption in infrared region
- **Near-Infrared (NIR) Spectroscopy**: Uses shorter wavelengths than IR
- **Raman Spectroscopy**: Based on inelastic scattering of photons
- **UV-Visible Spectroscopy**: Absorption in ultraviolet and visible light regions
- **Mass Spectrometry**: Analyzes ion mass-to-charge ratios
- **NMR Spectroscopy**: Uses nuclear magnetic resonance phenomenon

### Characteristics of Spectral Data

- High dimensionality (many wavelengths/variables)
- Multicollinearity between adjacent wavelengths
- Baseline variations and shifts
- Noise from various sources
- Sample-to-sample variability

## Preprocessing Spectral Data

### Noise Reduction

- **Savitzky-Golay Filtering**: Smoothing while preserving peak characteristics
- **Wavelet Denoising**: Multi-resolution approach for noise removal
- **Moving Average**: Simple smoothing for mild noise

### Baseline Correction

- **Asymmetric Least Squares**: Effective for curved baselines
- **Polynomial Fitting**: Models background as polynomial function
- **Rolling Ball**: Geometrically-inspired baseline correction

### Normalization

- **Standard Normal Variate (SNV)**: Reduces scatter effects
- **Multiplicative Scatter Correction (MSC)**: Corrects multiplicative and additive effects
- **Extended MSC (EMSC)**: Incorporates physical light scattering models

### Spectral Derivatives

- **First Derivative**: Enhances small spectral differences
- **Second Derivative**: Further enhances subtle features
- **Gap-Segment Derivatives**: More robust to noise than standard derivatives

## Feature Extraction for Spectral Data

### Peak Analysis

- **Peak Detection**: Identifying characteristic peaks
- **Peak Area Integration**: Quantifying peak intensity
- **Peak Ratios**: Comparing relative intensities

### Spectral Indices

- **Band Ratios**: Ratios between specific wavelength regions
- **Normalized Differences**: (A-B)/(A+B) calculations for wavelength pairs
- **Custom Indices**: Domain-specific calculations

### Dimensionality Reduction

- **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**: Linear technique for variance preservation
- **Partial Least Squares (PLS)**: Supervised dimensionality reduction
- **t-SNE**: Non-linear technique for visualization
- **UMAP**: Manifold learning for dimensionality reduction
