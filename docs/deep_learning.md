# Deep Learning

[‚Üê Back to Index](index.md)

Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that employs neural networks with multiple layers to progressively extract higher-level features from raw input data. This guide covers the fundamentals of deep learning architectures, training techniques, and applications with a focus on spectral data.

## Neural Network Basics

- **Neurons**: The basic computational units that perform weighted sums followed by activation functions
- **Layers**: Collections of neurons organized into input, hidden, and output layers
- **Activation Functions**: Non-linear transformations (ReLU, sigmoid, tanh) that enable complex pattern recognition
- **Forward Propagation**: Process of passing input through the network to generate predictions
- **Backpropagation**: Algorithm for calculating gradients for parameter updates

## Deep Learning Architectures

### Multilayer Perceptrons (MLPs)

- Fully connected layers of neurons
- Suitable for tabular data and basic pattern recognition
- Simple but effective for many spectral analysis tasks

### Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)

- Specialized for grid-like data (images, spectrograms)
- Feature extraction through convolutional filters
- Parameter sharing and local connectivity
- 1D CNNs are particularly effective for spectral data analysis

### Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)

- Process sequential data with memory of previous inputs
- LSTM and GRU cells mitigate the vanishing gradient problem
- Useful for time-series spectral data and sequential measurements

### Transformers

- Attention-based architecture that excels at capturing long-range dependencies
- Parallelizable training unlike RNNs
- Emerging applications in spectroscopy for complex pattern recognition

### Autoencoders

- Self-supervised models for dimensionality reduction and feature learning
- Encoder compresses input to a latent representation
- Decoder reconstructs input from the latent representation
- Useful for spectral data compression and anomaly detection

## Training Deep Neural Networks

### Optimization Algorithms

- **Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD)**: Simple but effective with proper learning rate scheduling
- **Adam**: Adaptive learning rates with momentum
- **RMSprop**: Suitable for RNNs and non-stationary problems

### Regularization Techniques

- **Dropout**: Randomly deactivates neurons during training
- **Batch Normalization**: Normalizes layer inputs for more stable training
- **Weight Decay**: Penalizes large weight values
- **Early Stopping**: Prevents overfitting by monitoring validation performance

### Transfer Learning

- Using pre-trained models as starting points for new tasks
- Fine-tuning vs. feature extraction approaches
- Particularly valuable when training data is limited
